    "Exercise 1 was a matter of setting up a continuous integration system to test our code.  This may be seen in the banner of the README document.\n",

    "\n",
    "We were presented with a Gaussian function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}},\\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right].$ This is a bell curve with a standard deviation of 1 and it is centered around x=0. The Gaussian distribution is particularly useful in statistics as a great many naturally occuring phenomena follow this distribution and working with this distribution is straightforward. As the curve is normalized so that the area underneath is equal to one, integrating Gaussian curve at an inverval of standard deviations yields the number of instances occuring within the specified deviations as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the given equation is normalized, we must show that the area underneath the graph is equal to one: $A=1=\\int\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}exp{\\frac{-x^2}{2}}dx$\n",
    "Computers are unable to use the concept of infinty in calculations.  As we cannot use infinitesimally segments of the interval to integrate, we will instead approximate the integral using a Reimann sum. By using sufficiently small segments of the interval, we can show that the curve is normalized: $\\lim_{dx\\to0} \\sum_{dx=a}^{b} g = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining the single variable function g(x=0) as the gaussian curve evaluated at a, it then may be called from other functions to calculate values in a manner that is verifiably correct via unit tests. To show that the equation is correct, its output while x=0 is compared to its known value."

Unit testing is used to verify this bit of intuition as well as check for accuracy in other qualities of this function. Here, test_interval() compares known values to generated values for a variety of imputs."
