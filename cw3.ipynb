    "Exercise 1 was a matter of setting up a continuous integration system to test our code.  This may be seen in the banner of the README document.\n",

    "### Exercise 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "We were presented with a Gaussian function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}},\\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right].$ This is a bell curve with a standard deviation of 1 and it is centered around x=0. The Gaussian distribution is particularly useful in statistics as a great many naturally occuring phenomena follow this distribution and working with this distribution is straightforward. As the curve is normalized so that the area underneath is equal to one, integrating Gaussian curve at an inverval of standard deviations yields the number of instances occuring within the specified deviations as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the given equation is normalized, we must approximate an integration of the curve using Reimann sum.  We may pick an interval of standard deviations near x=0 so that the integration value is known and show that as the width used for the Reimann sum becomes sufficiently small, the value calculation approaches the known value."
